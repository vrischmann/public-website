#### Software engineer

<div>

neezz.com was an email service startup. I was responsible for developing and deploying an email platform.

My primary responsibility was developing backend services to schedule, create, personalize, and send emails; I used Java, MySQL, Redis to do this.

My secondary responsibility was deploying and managing the server fleet where services were deployed; This involved provisioning bare-metal servers and managing configuration with Puppet.
