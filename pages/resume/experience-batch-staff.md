### Batch.com

2023/02 - Present

#### Staff engineer

<div>

Batch.com is a marketing automation platform serving billions of requests and push notifications per day.

After more than 9 years as a software engineer and senior software engineer at Batch, I got promoted to staff engineer.

My role is now focused on helping the different product squads achieve their goals, improve company engineering processes in collaboration with the CTO, assist with and review system designs, and helping multiply the effectiveness of our engineering teams.

I am also working with the _platform_ squad, helping improve the services, frameworks and libraries used by every team in the company.

Finally, I am lead of the backend _guild_; I help keep our backend stacks up to date, reduce frustration and improve quality of life for the guild members. Twice per month, we organize a _guild day_ where all guild members gather to work on projects that will improve our stacks.
