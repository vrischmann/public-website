### Batch.com

2013/12 - 2023/02

#### Senior backend engineer

<div>

Batch.com is a marketing automation platform serving billions of requests and push notifications per day.

I was one of the first members of the backend team and worked on the backend services for the last 8+ years, making them scale to support the growth of the company. I built the _sender_ services and scaled them to handle 400k push/s, I worked on the webservices serving our SDK with more than a billion request per day.

I also worked on the data processing pipelines, ingesting billions of data points produced by the SDK and responsible for maintaining customer user bases.

This was all done in Go, using Kafka, Cassandra, deployed on bare-metal with Kubernetes and Docker.

I was also involved with setting up the development processes, including unit tests, static analysis, code reviews, company-wide observability, and standardized deployment processes.

As a team lead I also had to coach and mentor new team members as well as help with technical designs and architectural decisions.
