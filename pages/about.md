I am a staff engineer at [Batch](https://batch.com), working on the backend side of our platform.

Most of my professional code is either in Go or Java, depending on the project.

My open source and hobby code is either in Go, Rust or Zig.

Besides coding, I spend most of my time gaming, walking and watching TV shows.
